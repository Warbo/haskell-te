# Haskell Theory Exploration Benchmarks #

This directory contains benchmarks for automated theory exploration tools. There
are two sorts of benchmarks:

### Standalone Theories ##

These are the files ending `.smt2`, and are written in the TIP format:

 - `benchmarks/nat-simple.smt2` is a simple theory of Natural numbers, with
   addition and multiplication, comparable to that used in [1] and [2]
 - `benchmarks/nat-full.smt2` is similar to `nat-simple.smt2` but also contains
   an exponentiation function, comparable to that used in [3]
 - `benchmarks/list-full.smt2` is a theory of lists, comparable to that used
   in [2]

The standalone benchmarks have a corresponding file in `ground-truth/`
containing the statements considered "interesting" for that theory (these are
taken from [1]).

### Theory Exploration Benchmark ##

We use the Theory Exploration Benchmark project, which includes a corpus of
definitions and statements. Subsets of these definitions are sampled
(deterministically), and the applicable statements are used as the ground truth.

## Running Benchmarks ##

We use `asv` to run the benchmarks and manage the results. A suitable
environment can be entered by running `nix-shell benchmarkEnv.nix` from the root
directory of this repository (i.e. the directory above this `benchmarks/` one).

The usual `asv` commands can be used: `asv run`, `asv publish`, etc.

Note that benchmarking can take a while. In particular, we do all of the
exploration in the 'setup' phase rather than in the benchmarks themselves; this
makes the setup phase slow, but the benchmarks which follow are almost instant.

Our policy is to commit benchmark results (which include the raw input/output
data and specs of the machine) to git to ensure reproducibility. We do two
things to save resources:

 - We don't commit any "derived" data. In particular, we don't include any HTML
   reports, since they can be regenerated automatically.
 - When we want to store a benchmark run, we first compress it with lzip. This
   *drastically* reduces the file size, and doesn't negatively affect git usage
   since these results will never change (that would be tampering!)

To store a result, commit any `benchmarks.json` and `machine.json` files as-is,
and lzip the benchmark output using a command like:

    lzip <       .asv/results/<machine-name>/<commit-id>-<args>.json \
         > benchmarks/results/<machine-name>/<commit-id>-<args>.json.lz

Commit the resulting `.json.lz` file, but not the original `.json` file. When
committing new results, keep in mind that the raw data can get quite large, and
these will hang around forever in git. Hence only include those which are
reliable (e.g. don't run benchmarks at the same time as other resource-intensive
programs).

To use this lzipped data with asv, it can simply be unzipped into place. The
benchmarking environment provides an `unzipBenchmarks` command which will do
this for you.
