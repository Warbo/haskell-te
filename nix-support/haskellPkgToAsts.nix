        haskellPkgToAsts extracts ASTs from the definitions made in a given
        Haskell project. A Haskell project is a directory containing a file
        whose name has a '.cabal' suffix.

        If the project doesn't have a default.nix file, we will try to make
        one using cabal2nix; if this causes problems, consider adding your
        own default.nix.

        ASTs are returned as JSON on stdout.
